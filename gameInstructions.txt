After a triumph at the presidential elections you are now the president of the USA. As every respectable leader of a
nation,you are very vocal on your Twitter account. However, what is more annoying than an open border between the USA
and Mexico ? Fake News. You despise fake news. So instead of meeting with senators and diplomats all day you decide to
isolate yourself in the round office and scroll down your Twitter feed and hunt down these horrible fake news.

Throughout the course of this game, you will be presented with tweets. If you decide that the tweet is fake news or
would harm the integrity of your country you denounce the tweet. If the tweet seems legit you can support the tweet.
Each action you take will have an effect on the 4 main factors of your country. Judging by the nature of the tweet,
these effects will be either positive or negative towards each factor. Try to predict what effect the tweets would have
and plan accordingly. These 4 factors are : Money, Happiness, Opposition, and Army. If one of the factions reaches below
a level 0 or above a level 100, the game is over.

Your goal is to reach the next presidential elections with a Opposition of less than 50. The presidential elections will
 automatically take place after 30 tweets.
